# Bad UI Battle
---
Inspired by subreddit [r/badUIbattles](https://www.reddit.com/r/badUIbattles/), this is a repository for all the bad UI I've seen.

That is the [interactive](https://goulartnogueira.github.io/BadUI/) GitHub page for this repository.

Please [contribute](https://github.com/GoulartNogueira/BadUI/pulls) with your own *shitty UI*!

# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Awesome Bad UI
# Description:
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Inspired by Reddit r/badUIbattles (a joke subreddit for intentionally bad UI designs), I created BadUI as an open repository for BadUI's made by me and others.
  This repository contains all best (or worst?) bad-UI I've seen.
